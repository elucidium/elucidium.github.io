This page is intended to be a digital *curriculum vitae* for my musical endeavors, including a comprehensive list of projects, collaborations, performances, etc. in which I've been involved! Long story short, I spend 95% of my time outside of academics working on music-related extracurriculars, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
