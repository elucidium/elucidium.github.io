This page (rev. 02/06/2024) is intended to be a digital *curriculum vitae* for my musical endeavors, including a comprehensive list of projects, collaborations, performances, etc. in which I've been involved! This is how I spend most of my time outside of work/academics, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

Any publicly available recordings of my work are linked below. I've also taken the liberty of linking collaborators and organizations with whom I've been fortunate enough to work.

While at CMU, Ruiran was assistant conductor for the **CMU All-University Orchestra**; music directed three mainstage productions by **Scotch'n'Soda Theatre**, CMU's student-led theatre organization; and contributed to many more productions and projects in various capacities (composer, arranger, pianist).

Ruiran has contributed to many productions throughout the Bay as a music director, vocal director, rehearsal pianist, and/or audition pianist. She has also subbed as a rehearsal pianist, pit keyboardist, and/or conductor for other projects. Companies she's worked at include Marin Theatre Company (*JUSTICE: A New Musical*), Sunnyvale Community Players (*Next to Normal*, *The Little Mermaid*, *Sweeney Todd*), Cabrillo Stage (*The Hunchback of Notre Dame*), The Pear Theatre (*Falsettos*), and South Bay Musical Theatre (*A Little Night Music*).

She is particularly interested in developing new works as a music director and/or music assistant, and will be relocating to NYC in the summer of 2024.
