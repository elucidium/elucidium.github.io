This page is intended to be a digital *curriculum vitae* for my musical endeavors, including a comprehensive list of projects, collaborations, performances, etc. in which I've been involved! This is how I spend most of my time outside of work/academics, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

Any publicly available recordings of my work are linked below. I've also taken the liberty of linking collaborators and organizations with whom I've worked. Please explore!

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:xun.ruiran@gmail.com) with any questions.

## skills I have

### instruments
- piano (15+ years)
- violin (10+ years)
- mallet percussion (2 years in high school, primarily marimba)
- voice (3+ years, caveat: I have no formal training in vocal pedagogy but I've accrued a good amount of working knowledge over the years)

### software
- MainStage 3
- Dorico Pro 3.5
- Logic Pro
- GarageBand
- Audacity

### other
- Music direction  
*c.f. "Productions and Performances" section above*
- Sightreading  
*high proficiency; I'll happily sightread anything*
- Conducting  
*1 year of coursework, plus practical experience working with the CMU All-University Orchestra and conducting pits for shows I music direct*
- Arranging and transcription  
*I've learned that I can transcribe by ear very quickly*

## skills I would like to acquire
- A more formalized knowledge of **vocal technique**, both in classical and contemporary contexts! Everything I currently know is secondhand from being in rehearsal rooms with people far more experienced than me.
- A working knowledge of **orchestration** so that I can better assist in developing new musicals.
- An understanding of **sound engineering** beyond the working knowledge I've picked up while music directing!
