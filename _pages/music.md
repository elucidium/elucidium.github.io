## biography

**Ruiran Xun**<sup>[*]</sup> (she/her) is a collaborative pianist, music director, and conductor.

She is a 2022 graduate of Carnegie Mellon University, where she received B.S. degrees in chemistry and computer science, along with a minor in collaborative piano. Ruiran previously worked with the **Pittsburgh Festival Opera** and the **CMU School of Music**. While at CMU, she was assistant conductor for the **All-University Orchestra**; music directed three mainstage productions by **Scotch'n'Soda Theatre**, a student-led theatre organization; and participated in many more projects in various capacities (composer, arranger, pianist).

From 2022 to 2024, while residing in the SF Bay Area, Ruiran contributed to many productions as a music/vocal director and rehearsal/audition pianist. She also frequently subbed on other projects. Some local companies she's worked for include **Sunnyvale Community Players** (*Next to Normal*, *The Little Mermaid*, *Sweeney Todd*), **Cabrillo Stage** (*The Hunchback of Notre Dame*, *In the Heights*), **The Pear Theatre** (*Falsettos*), **South Bay Musical Theatre** (*A Little Night Music*, *Mary Poppins*), **Foothill Music Theatre** (*Legally Blonde*), and **Stanford TAPS** (*Assassins*).
