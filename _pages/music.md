This page (rev. 01/16/2025) is intended to be a comprehensive, digital *curriculum vitae* for all my musical and theatrical work. Fair warning: it's a lot of details. Feel free to [skip the fine print with this résumé](/assets/pdf/xun-ruiran-music-public.pdf) or [contact me](mailto:xun.ruiran@gmail.com) with any questions!

## biography

**Ruiran Xun**<sup>[*]</sup> (she/her) is an NYC-based collaborative pianist, music director, and conductor. 

She is a 2022 graduate of Carnegie Mellon University, where she received B.S. degrees in chemistry and computer science, but was consistently involved in theatre and other musical endeavors outside of academics. She also earned a minor in collaborative piano from the School of Music. Ruiran has previously worked with the **Pittsburgh Festival Opera** (resident artist pianist, assistant music director) and the **CMU School of Music** (voice lesson and rehearsal pianist). While at CMU, she was assistant conductor for the **All-University Orchestra**; music directed three mainstage productions by **Scotch'n'Soda Theatre**, a student-led theatre organization; and participated in many more projects in various capacities (composer, arranger, pianist).

From 2022 to 2024, while residing in the SF Bay Area, Ruiran contributed to many productions as a music director, vocal director, rehearsal pianist, and/or audition pianist. She has also subbed as a rehearsal pianist, pit keyboardist, and/or conductor for other projects. Some local companies she's worked for include **Sunnyvale Community Players** (*Next to Normal*, *The Little Mermaid*, *Sweeney Todd*), **Cabrillo Stage** (*The Hunchback of Notre Dame*, *In the Heights*), **The Pear Theatre** (*Falsettos*), **South Bay Musical Theatre** (*A Little Night Music*, *Mary Poppins*), **Foothill Music Theatre** (*Legally Blonde*), and **Stanford TAPS** (*Assassins*).

Ruiran is particularly interested in developing new works as a music director and/or music assistant. Recent new work credits include *JUSTICE: A New Musical*, written by Lauren Gunderson, Kait Kerrigan, and Bree Lowdermilk (music director, **Marin Theatre Company** workshop & production, 2022–2023); *TRAVELS*, written by James Harrison Monaco (music assistant, **Ars Nova** workshop, 2023); and *MARIAN*, composed by Chelsea Marie Davis and Victoria Theodore (music assistant, **City College of New York** workshop, 2024).
