Hello! I'm Ruiran Xun, and this is my AMD application to the Bucks County Playhouse production of *Bridges of Madison County*. I'm a music director and collaborative pianist currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area, but am of course willing to travel for the gig. I have plenty of experience music directing and piano-conducting; feel free to view more details on my website's music page [here](/music), or my PDF resume [here](/assets/pdf/xun-ruiran-music-public.pdf).

Below are three excerpts for your consideration!

#### #14 "Before and After You / A Million Miles", mm. 76–91
Yes, it's *that* part :)

#### #2 "Home Before You Know It", mm. 9–38
A classic JRB syncopated groove.
