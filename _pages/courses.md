This page is inspired by [some](https://wanshenl.me/courses/reviews/) [similar](https://pranavkumar.me/courses/) [pages](https://abigalekim.github.io/courses/) I've seen before and mostly exists for me to reflect upon my experience completing two (very disjoint) degrees at CMU in four years.

A ☆ indicates a course that was particularly engaging and interesting to me (relative to other courses in that semester).

## Summer 2019
I spent five weeks doing **polymer synthesis research** through CMU's Summer Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship with the Noonan lab, then worked with the Pittsburgh Festival Opera as a **resident artist pianist** for six weeks.

I really enjoyed this summer! I was incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunities to explore multiple fields of interest.

### Courses
- (99270) Summer Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship

## Fall 2019

## Spring 2020

This was the semester that completely shifted to remote halfway through; the shift ended up not being much of an issue for all of my courses except for 09222 (which transitioned to writing lab reports pre-recorded experiment footage and data) and 09445 (which unfortunately just had to completely stop). Additionally, as a TA I had to adjust to teaching remotely (shoutout to SCS for helping us out by reimbursing TAs for tablets).

### Courses

## Summer 2020

I originally had another internship offer lined up, but the program was cancelled due to COVID-19. After receiving that news, I signed up for online summer courses at CMU and went through the re-hiring process on LinkedIn, eventually receiving an offer to work remotely at Network Medical Management as a **software engineer intern**.

I'm genuinely surprised that this summer worked out as well as it did, given that I lost my initial summer plans. That being said, I'm incredibly fortunate that I was able to quarantine with family, focusing solely on my coursework and the full-stack development I did at my internship.

### Courses
- (15150) Principles of Functional Programming ☆
- (15213) Introduction to Computer Systems

## Fall 2020

This semester felt like a rough ride all the way through given pandemic circumstances; it was hard at times to figure out whether I was doing more than I could handle or if remote learning was making everything more difficult. I ended up dropping a course (15316: Software Foundations of Security and Privacy) so that I could spend more time on 09344 and 15312, a move which definitely served me well! I also got to teach recitations and take 57332 in-person (modulo COVID precautions), which made me feel a lot more grounded than I otherwise would have.

## Summer 2021

I worked remotely as a **software engineer intern** with Palo Alto Networks on the NGFW System-test QA team. In addition, I was a teaching assistant for the summer iteration of [15-122](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~iliano/courses/21N-CMU-CS122/), and composed music for a play named *The Great Hunger* that premiered in NYC September 2021.
