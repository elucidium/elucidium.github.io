## Summer 2019
I spent five weeks doing **polymer synthesis research** through CMU's Summer Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship with the Noonan lab, then worked with the Pittsburgh Festival Opera as a **resident artist pianist** for six weeks.

I really enjoyed this summer! I was incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunities to explore multiple fields of interest.

## Summer 2020
I originally had another internship offer lined up, but the program was cancelled due to COVID-19. After receiving that news, I signed up for online summer courses at CMU and went through the re-hiring process on LinkedIn, eventually receiving an offer to work at Network Medical Management as a **software engineer intern**.

I'm genuinely surprised that this summer worked out as well as it did, given that I lost my initial summer plans. That being said, I'm incredibly fortunate that I was able to quarantine with family, focusing solely on my coursework and the full-stack development I did at my internship.
