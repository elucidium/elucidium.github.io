My personal website! Some implementation details:

- The website was designed to be responsive using Bootstrap Studio; the HTML and CSS were then fine-tuned.
- I used [particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js) for the fancy particle effects in the jumbotron.
- The website is deployed through Github Pages, using a custom domain from Namecheap.
- A Comodo PositiveSSL certificate was activated and installed in order to secure connections to the website.

## Changelog
- 20200324: Initial design (multi-page)
- 20200725: Redesign (single page, JS animations/effects)
